# 0x02 - Python Import & Modules
A python [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) is a file that contains python definitions and statements that can be reused. The filename is coined by combining the module name and `.py`. The module name in the module is usually stored in the global variable `__name__`.
